# replay tutorial

This repo contains a tutorial that introduces developers to the [replay](https://github.com/corverroos/replay) framework.

Each sub-folder contains a simple go program. Some are purely examples and can just be studied and run with `go run`. 
Others contain `TODO(you)` that must completed before the program will run successfully.

- [00_helloworld](./00_helloworld/main.go) 
- [01_typedhello](./01_typedhello/main.go) 
- [02_signalhello](./02_signalhello/main.go) 

Just clone this repo to follow along.

Running the programs can be done in IDE's supporting go:generate or from the command line.
```
go run github.com/corverroos/replaytutorial/00_helloworld
# Exit early with Ctrl-C to test restart robustness
```
